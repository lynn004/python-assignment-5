# Python OOP Assignment 🐍

This is my first project using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.  
It includes two parts:  

---

## Part 1: Book Class 📖
- I created a `Book` class.  
- It has attributes like `title`, `author`, and `pages`.  
- It also has simple methods such as `read()` and `book_info()` to make the object feel alive.  
- Example: when you call `read()`, it prints `"You start reading..."`.

---

## Part 2: Polymorphism with Cars 🚗
- For this part, I created different types of cars.  
- Each car has a `move()` method, but they all work differently (polymorphism).  
  - `Car.move()` → prints `"The car is moving 🚗"`  
  - `ElectricCar.move()` → prints `"The electric car is driving silently ⚡"`  
  - `SportsCar.move()` → prints `"The sports car speeds away! 🏎️"`

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repo or download the files.  
2. Open a terminal in the folder.  
3. Run the file with:
   ```bash
